## IMDB Weighted Rating Formula

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **IMDb Weighted Rating Formula**, a method used by IMDb to calculate movie ratings in a way that balances individual movie ratings with overall ratings across all movies. The weighted rating ensures that movies with fewer votes do not disproportionately affect rankings compared to more popular movies.

## Formula Explanation

IMDb uses the following formula to calculate the **weighted rating** for each movie:

Weighted_Rating = (v/(v+M) * r) + (M/(v+M) * C)


Where:
- **v**: The number of votes for the movie.
- **M**: The minimum number of votes required to be listed in the Top 250.
- **r**: The average rating of the movie.
- **C**: The mean vote across the entire report (the average rating across all movies).

### Formula Breakdown

1. **(v/(v+M) * r)**:
   - This part of the formula emphasizes the movie's own rating **r**, giving it more weight if the movie has received a large number of votes (**v**).
   - The fraction **v/(v+M)** determines how much weight is given to the movie's own average rating based on its vote count.

2. **(M/(v+M) * C)**:
   - This part introduces a baseline by adding the overall average rating **C** into the calculation.
   - The fraction **M/(v+M)** ensures that movies with fewer votes have less impact, allowing the general average rating to have more influence in such cases.

### Key Points

- **Balancing Act**: The formula ensures that movies with only a small number of votes do not dominate the rankings, thanks to the introduction of the overall average rating **C** and the minimum vote requirement **M**.
  
- **Minimum Votes (M)**: The inclusion of a minimum vote threshold mitigates the impact of movies with only a few votes, requiring them to have significant engagement before their ratings can heavily influence rankings.

- **Weighted Influence**: The more votes a movie receives (**v**), the greater the influence of its own rating (**r**) on the final score. Conversely, if a movie has fewer votes, the general average rating (**C**) holds more sway.

This approach helps IMDb maintain a fair and balanced rating system, ensuring that highly rated movies with only a few votes don’t rank unfairly high compared to widely rated films.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Implement IMDb’s weighted rating formula to calculate movie ratings based on the number of votes, average rating of the movie, and overall average rating.
- Understand how the balance between a movie’s rating and the general average rating affects final rankings.

## Conclusion

The **IMDb Weighted Rating Formula** ensures a balanced approach to calculating movie ratings by taking into account both the number of votes and the general trend of all movies. This results in a more accurate representation of movie rankings that reflect both popular opinion and general audience feedback.
